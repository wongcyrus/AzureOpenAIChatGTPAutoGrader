However, there were several weeks where no progress was made, resulting in a deduction of marks. It's important for the student to maintain constant progress in order to optimize their marks in this project. In the future, it would be beneficial for the student to plan out their tasks and schedule their work to avoid extended periods of inactivity. The student showed contribution towards the project and demonstrated technical skills. However, there were instances where the task completion did not show coherence and cohesion with the project. Overall, the student has shown a good effort and potential to improve. Keep up the good work!\", 'noOfWeekDoingNothing': 6, 'tokens': 1351, 'error': False}\n"
